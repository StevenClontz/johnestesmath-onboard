  "title": "The Goal of Onboarding to Mathematics",
  "body": " The Goal of Onboarding to Mathematics  Welcome to Overview of Mathematics! This book is different in its aim from most mathematics texts that you'll encounter. Whereas most textbooks will dig into the details of a particular topic (one topic, no doubt, worth the effort it takes to dig into it), Onboarding to Mathematics will look at a variety of topics.   Who is this book for?   Most in-coming mathematics majors probably choose their major because of the success they had in high school I chose to study mathematics in college just because I enjoyed my high school courses and wanted to do some more math. But what do math majors do? What is in store for the freshman math major?  This text is for the young math major (and anyone interested in what undergraduate mathematics thinks abouts), so that they know   What this book is not   We should mention that this book is not exhaustive in any sense. We will not turn over every stone on any given subject and will look at these subjects at a somewhat surface level. We also admit that certain things will be left out, but we are confident those topics will be addressed at a sophisticated level in separate courses.   So what is the point of this book?    \"Onboarding\" is the process of introducing a new person into the culture and customs of an organization, and that is exactly what this text is about. Onboarding to Mathematics seeks to introduce students to the wonderful world of mathematics and its vibrant community.  In particular, we hope to introduce  the culture of the mathematics community both locally at Belhaven along with the broader community of mathematicians across the world,  snapshots of common math topics in interactive ways,  and skills to maximize success as a student..  And we hope to have some fun while doing it.  Best practices for this course are just showing up with a good attitude and having a curiosity about math topics.  Let's get started!  "

  "title": "Sets and Shopping Carts",
  "body": " Sets and Shopping Carts  Sunday afternoon at the local supermarket is a bustling place. Shoppers cut each other off for the last jar of salsa with a smile and a 'pardon me'. Amid the somewhat friendly and mostly competitive crowd, long-time friends Yuri and Kalo bump into each other in front of the caulifluer. It's always a bit awkward looking into someone else's shopping cart (feels like a violation of privacy, right?), but Yuri couldn't help but notice that there was some overlap.  PUT A FIGURE HERE  \"Hey, I like rice cakes, too. Look!\" exclaimed Yuri holding up a bag of rice cakes from his cart.  \"Oh, I hate them! Those are for my mom,\" replied Kalo. Yuri frowned.  Anyway... the two carts looked like this:     Yuri's cart  Kalo's cart    rice cakes  rice cakes    caulifleur  caulifleur    halibut  tuna    coffee creamer  crab legs    spicy ramen  spicy ramen    cilantro  parsley    yellow onion  red onion    corn chips  cookies    salami  bagels    eggs  salami      cream cheese      Collections of Things  There's some mathematics going on here. Anytime we have find a collection of items (like a shopping cart) we have a mathematical object called a set.  A set is simply a collection of objects referred to as elements .  Let's call the set of Yuri's cart , written as { rice cakes, caulifluer, halibut, coffee creamer, spicy ramen, cilantro, yellow onion, corn chips, salami, eggs } . Similarly {rice cakes, caulifluer, tuna, crab legs, spicy ramen, parsley, red onion, cookies, bagels, salami, and cream cheese} is the set representing Kalo's cart. So halibut is an element of (written as halibet ), and tuna .  The overlap between their two carts represents the \"intersection of Y and K\", .  In general for sets and , the intersection of and  , , is the set of elements in both sets.  PUT A FIGURE HERE      Yuri and Kalo's intersection   What would contain?    Another friend interrupts Yuri and Kalo's meeting. JACOBI greets them both as they unapologetically rifle through his cart.  JACOBI's cart is represented by the set {spicy ramen, cilantro, corn chips, and eggs}. Yuri can't help notice that everything in is also in . In this case, we say that is a subset of , denoted or .  So set if for any element , we know also that .     Subsets of Dairy   Let be the set of all dairy items. Find a subset of that is also a subset of .     Is the intersection a subset?   Is a subset of ?    Unbeknownst to Kalo, Kalo's wife MARNIE is also in the grocery store with {caulifluer, macaroni, red onion, water, bacon}. When Kalo and MARNIE bump into each other, they decide to finish their shopping and to consolidate their items to one cart. Kalo reshelves the caulifluer and red onion, though, since MARNIE already has those items in her cart. This new cart is known as the \"union of K and M\", .  In general, for sets and , is the collection of elements that are in either set (or both).   Question of union   What is ?     Another question of union   What is ?     More complicated sets   What about ?      Venn Diagrams  We can visualize how sets interact with each using overlapping circles with diagrams known as Venn diagrams.  Some examples:     VENN DIAGRAM OF MCU, SW, LOTR actors.    Human Venn Diagrams  You will now be human Venn diagrams (This works best in an open area).    Team Challenge  Teams give an elt in called out sets like A UNION B INTERSECT C, etc.   Remember that our goal is to introduce you to topics you'll cover in more detail later. There are other set operations that we won't cover here. You'll see these in classes like Discrete Mathematics, Modern Algebra, and many others.  "

  "title": "A Special Triangle",
  "body": " A Special Triangle  You can find all sorts of interesting examples of surprising structures in the universe of mathematics. One such example is a very special triangle of numbers that's easy to construct and borderline ubiquitous in its applications.  This triangle goes by many names and was discovered by several cultures in history. In 450 BC, Indian mathematician, Pingata, called this new construction the \"Staircase of Mount Meru\". Persian mathematician, Omar Khayyam, discovered \"Khauuam's Triangle\" in the 11th century, and close to the same time, Chinese mathematician, Jin Xian, discovered \"Yang Hui's Triangle\". In the western world, this triangle is most commonly refered to as Pascal's Triangle, named after french mathematician, Blaise Pascal, who discovered this triangle in the 17th century.        Constructing Pascal's Triangle  Now you're going to build Pascal's Triangle. The row is just a , and the second row is composed of . The third row looks like like below. We'll call these rows row 0, row 1, and row 2.                          Where did the come from? We simply got it by adding the two 's above it in row 1. For the next row (row 3), we'd start with . Then we have the sum of the two numbers above our second number ( ). Next is the sum ( ), and finally we end the row with 1. That is, row 3 is .  Then we just repeat this process.   Row 4   Fill out row 4 of Pascal's Triangle.    Following the same process, row 4 has entries or .      Fill out the first 8 rows of Pascal's Triangle.  Pascal's triangle has interested mathematicians for centuries, as it is filled with interesting patterns.   Adding along a row   Add entries of rows 0 through 4. What pattern do you notice?    The sume of entries of rows 0 through 4 are respectively. These looks like powers of .    This is just one pattern of Pascal's triangle, but there are many more. TedEd hightlights some of these patterns in this very visual video.      Use TedEd's video and Pascal's Triangle to answer the following.

  "body": " Introduction to Belhaven Mathematics  Welcome to the Mathematics and Computer Science Department (MCS) at Belhaven University, one department under Belhaven's School of Science & Mathematics. We work hard to provide unique learning opportunities, to do a lot of math, and to have fun while we grow. Maybe we can best summarize what Belhaven MCS is about with the three crucial pillars of our identity:  Community,  Academic experiences,  Service.     Keep these pillars in mind Community. Academic experiences. Service.  We believe that our students reach their greatest potential by following these pillars, and we strive to incorporate these values throughout our curriculum.   Community      Do you want to get the most out of your college experience? We picked community as our first pillar for a reason. We want you to be a part of something special! While we provide opportunities for you, it's up to you to take advantage of them.  But we have a lot of opportunities for you to get involved quickly!   MCS Club  The student-led MCS Club.    STEM Events  The MCS Department and the School of Science and Mathematics  Homecoming  Instagram, Facebook  picnics and more things  STEM Seminar      Good Communication  Good communication is so undervalued. Go talk to your professors. At Belhaven, we want to know our students. Meet your classmates. They're going to help you through this next assignmnent.  Join the BelhavenSTEM Team. We post about upcoming events and have a channel specific to internships, scholarships, and research opportunities.     Belhaven Maker Campus        Your degree is measured in credit hours. You're taking classes ultimately to earn a degree. You'll also expect some grades in those classes. BUT let's be careful not to mistake grades and credit hours with actual learning. Our goal in the MCS Department is provide an environment of true learning. We want you to adapt a mentality of a continual learning: one who learns inside and outside of the classroom.  In addition to core classes such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, and Differential Equations, Belhaven's MCS department delivers a number curriculum add-ons. Let's take a look at what additional academic experiences we offer.   Mathematical Research  In MAT 391, 392, 491 and 492, students participate in the mathematical research process reviewing recent results of a select topic and attempting to further it. These students will present their findings as a poster and presentation at the Belhaven University Undergraduate Research Symposium (BUURS) and our sectional meetings of the MAA.    The Eyes of Faith Portfolio  What does the Bible say about mathematics? What does life as a Christian mathematician entail? What role does change and randomness play in God's creation? These are deep questions that we will ask ourselves during throughout our mathematics coursework at Belhaven.  The book Mathematics through the Eyes of Faith by Russell Howell and James Bradley approaches these questions in an intellectually honest manner . Students will use this text as a reference to write their own thoughts in their Eyes of Faith Portfolio , a collaboration of Eyes of Faith papers written over several courses covering chapter of our reference text.  The chapter breakdown follows curiously close to our major requirements and is summarized in the following table. (You might want to hang on to this one.)  Eyes of Faith Portfolio        Course  Course Name  Eyes Chapter    MAT 207  Calculus I   1. The Big Questions     MAT 208  Calculus II   2. The Historical Context     MAT 209  Calculus III   3. Infinity     MAT 210  Calculus IV   7. Beauty     MAT 303  Discrete Mathematics   6. Proof and Truth     MAT 304  Differential Equations   8. Effectiveness     MAT 305  Statistics and Probability   5. Chance     MAT 311  Linear Algebra   4. Dimension     MAT 410  Advanced Calculus   9. Epistemology     MAT 491  Intro to Math Research I   10. Ontology     MAT 492  Intro to Math Research II   11. An Apology         For Engineering Majors  In addition to academic experiences math majors experience, students in Belhaven's engineering partnership  learn AutoCAD in PHY 119 Intro to Engineering  interact with professional engineers from places like Yates construction, Raytheon, and Asset Engineering.  take site visits to Ole Miss, Mississippi State, and places like Nissan and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Research and Development Center (ERDC).      For Actuarial Science Majors  For those majoring in Actuarial Sciences (ASM), students will  learn statistical software such as R,  sit for the first actuarial exam, the Probability Exam (SOA Exam P).      Seminars  Several times a year, we bring in speakers to present topics not typically covered in a standard course. Attending these talks is a fantastic way to meet professionals who are doing what you hope to do one day and reinforces our pillars of community and academic experiences.  Just a few examples:  professors from other universities sharing their research  professional actuaries looking for interns  scientists from NASA, the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, and the US Corps of Engineers  industry professionals in the fields of engineerng and computer science.     Young students often underestimate the power of good communication. The quicker you get comfortable with communicating with peers, professors, and advisors the better. In addition to email, most courses in the MCS utilize Microsoft Teams, a professional, team-building messaging app. The quickest and easiest way to support the Community pillar of the MCS Mission Statement is to simply download Teams, join our course's team (listed in the syllabus), join the BelhavenSTEM team, and turn on notifications in both!

  "body": " Logically Speaking  Let's assume that if gordentockles borg the headenvorsh, then the dezapatos changs the wungwing. Also, we all know that if the dezapatos changs the wungwing, then chimi dupas the mongo-gale. But does that means that if gordentockles borg the headenvorsh, then chimi dupas the mongo-gale?  What? What was that?  You have probably seen theorem statements in textbooks like the Mean Value Theorem below. If you are like me, then you probably skipped all of the words and jumped to the big equation. Right?   Mean Value Theorem   If is a function that is continuous on and differentiable on , then there is a number in such that     It's okay if you have no idea what any of that means. The Mean Value Theorem will have more meaning in Calculus. For now, just notice that has the form if some stuff then some more stuff.  Actually, the nonsensical paragraph opening this session has several \" if some stuff then some more stuff\" statements. These type of statements are called conditional statements, and we can represent them symbolically like . We we know logically that implies that if occurs, then will follow.   Gordentockles and Chimi  Earlier we were asked whether we know for sure that if gordentockles borg the headenvorsh, then chimi dupas the mongo-gale. Let's represent the statement \"gordentockles borg the headenvorsh\" with , the statement \"the dezapatos changs the wungwing\" with , and the statement \"chimi dupas the mongo-gale\" with .      How would we represent symbolically the statement \"if gordentockles borg the headenvorsh, then the dezapatos changs the wungwing\"?    This is a conditional statement: .      How would we represent symbolically the statement \"if the dezapatos changs the wungwing, then the chimi dupas the mongo-gale\"?    This is a conditional statement: .    From and , we have two conditionals and . So if occurs, then occurs, and if occurs, then so does . So is it not true then, that if occurs, then occurs?    What does mean? And is it true based upon what we know?    The conditional statement reads as \"if gordentockles borg the headenvorsh, then chimi dupas the mongo-gale\", and it is true based upon what we know.      The Usefulness of Logic  Logic helps us safely traverse through mathematical statements. As we'll see later, all proof writing depends on principles of logic, and having a good understanding of the basics of logic will help us make sense of things that are initially unintuitive.  The past few exercises showed a couple of things. Firstly, that we can follow the logic of an argument even if we're not overly familiar with the contents of the article. Do we even know what a gordentockle is? Secondly, we arrived to some transitive form of conditionals. We decided that if and , then . Logicians can string together simpler logic statements to arrive to new, more complicated statements.  Take a look at the tree REF below, in which each edge is a conditional statement.  FIGURE HERE OF LOGIC TREE      If is true, what else do we know for sure is true?    We know and is true, so is true.        Starting with , what things must be true to guarantee that is true?    To guarantee that is true, we must have to be true as well. Note that we do not know if this is only reason is true or not, but the way we can guarantee it.        Suppose is not true. What else do we know for sure is not true?    It is tempting to say that and are not true, but we don't know that actually! What we know is that . So if is true and is false, then we have a contradiction. So if is false, then must be false.      Contrapositives   gave us a new rule of logic. Supposing is true and is false, we now know that must be false. We'll write to mean \"not \", and so our new rule could be stated as .  This new statement, , is called the contrapositive , and the conditional and the contrapostive are logically equivalent statments. This means, that if one is true, then they're both true, and if one is false, they're both false.  Contrapositives are very useful.    What is the contrapostive of the statment \"if the dezapatos changs the wungwing, then chimi dupas the mongo-gale\"?    If chimi does not dupas the mongo-gale, then the dezapatos does not chang the wungwing.      Make up three conditional \"if-then\" statements and write them down. Trade your conditionals with a classmate and write the contrapositive to your classmate's conditional statements.      Knights and Knaves  Mathematician (and magician) Raymond Smullyan (1919-2017) famously wrote several books of logic puzzles. The puzzles have entertained and challenged people for decades. You can find a list of his works at the https:\/\/www.raymondsmullyan.com\/bio\/  PIC HERE SMULLYAN OR AN ISLAND  One set of his puzzles involve the reader (you) visiting an island in which there lives two types of people. Knights ALWAYS tell the truth, and Knaves ALWAY lie. In many of these puzzles, you engage in a brief discussion with two or more island inhabitants, and based upon their statements you are challenged with identifying what type of people each person is.  Let's try a few.   Knight and Knaves I   You encounter two island residents, and , each is either a knight or a knave. makes the following statement: \"At least one of us is a knave.\" What are and ?     Knight and Knaves II   Suppose says, \"Either I am a knave or is a knight.\" What are and ?     Knight and Knaves III   This time, you encounter three people , each of whom is either a knight or knave. and make the following statements:    What are , and ?

The Pregel river flowed through the middle of the city forming two islands. The part we care about, though, is the seven bridges highlighted in FIGURE.  The incredibly brilliant mathematician, Leonhard Euler (1707-1783), proposed the now famous question: Can someone take a tour of Konigsburg in which all seven bridges are crossed exactly one time, and the tourist returns back to his or her starting position? If so, we'll call that a successful tour of Konigsburg.    Can you find a successful tour of Konigsburg?        Connectivity    Six Degrees of Separation   "

  "body": " Coloring Graphs  Consider the map of the United States in figure \\ref{map}. You are challenged to color the map with the rule that bordering states cannot have the same color. Overall this is pretty easy, BUT we also want to use the fewest colors possible. How many colors do you need to do this?   Color the map   Color the map in the fewest colors possible, where neighboring states do not share a color.             How many colors?   So how many colors did it take to color your map?    The minimum number of colors is .    In this context, if we treat each state as a vertex and shared borders as edges, then this map is just a graph. The challenge we gave to color the map then is really a challenge to color a graph with this rule: if two vertices share an edge, those vertices must be different colors.  Finding the minimum colors to color a graph is a common graph theory question.   Coloring Trees  A graph is called a tree if it is connected and has no cycles. More precisely, there is a path between any two vertices... but only one path.  TIKZ PIC OF A TREE      How many colors does the tree in TIKZ PIC require?    Only two!        Draw three of your own trees on at least vertices. How many colors do your new trees require?    Do you we know how many colors any tree will require now? Is it possible that all trees can be colored in two colors? Based on our examples, we want to say \"yes\", but a few examples is not enough to say for sure in the world of mathematics.  Maybe we can make a logical argument to show trees can be colored in two colors, though. Let's start with a vertex (call it ) and color it . Also, we say a vertex is a neighbor of (or adjacent to ) if it shares an edges with .    What color can we color the neighbors of ?      What color can we color the neighbors of the neighbors of ?      What about the neighbors of the neighbors of the neighbors of ?    Okay, maybe we have found a pattern.    What color can we color a vertex that is an odd number of edges away from ? what about a vertex an even number of edges from ?    This argument only works, though, because we're talking about trees. If there is a cycle in our graph, then a vertex may an even number of edges from coming from one direction and an odd number of edges from another direction. That can't happen in a tree.  Awesome. So trees can be colored in two colors.    What about Cycles?  So we know trees can be colored in two colors, and our argument really needed the fact the trees do not have cycles. So what about cycles? Can a cycle be colored in two colors?     Coloring cycles   Draw four cycles on vertices for different values of (I recommend consecutive values of ) and color their vertices.        Give a hypothesis on the number of colors a cycle on vertices requires to be colored.    After observing several cycles, we conclude that if is even, the cycle requires two colors. However, if is odd, the cycle requires three colors.      Appel and Haken shook things up  We'll now turn our attention to something similar to coloring the map of the US. Is it possible to draw a country with states that would require more than four colors? The answer is actually no!  In 1976, Appel and Haken proved their famous Four Color Theorem, but this result brought a good bit of controversy. Numberphile's fantastic video belows covers the controversy surrounding the Four Color Theorem.  Use the following video to answer the following questions.

  "body": " A Little History  Mathematics is a permanent fixture in human development. We find evidence of mathematical thinking in our most ancient of civilizations, and yet all modern technological advancements rely of good mathematics. Mathematics is the foundational tool we use to turn creative ideas into reality. But the human stories of mathematics is an area worth studying as well.  INSERT PIC HERE  Throughout your coursework, you will learn about the interesting figures of math history and some of the incredible (and sometimes unbelievable) tales they are a part of. There are stories of young genius, incredible risks, underdogs, and duels. You will hear about mathematical giants from all over the world and how their contributions are still valuable to us today. Math history is rich and immensely interesting.   What we take for granted  We learn about rationals, primes, and equations by the time we get to middle school, but so many of these ideas were unknown for generations. We take so much of our foundational mathematics for granted, but behind a lot of these concepts are moments of ingenious insight.  For example,   Our numerals are referred as \"Hindu-Arabic numerals\" invented by Indian mathematicians between the first and fourth centuries.     The discovery of irrational numbers threw the Pythagoreans into an existential crisis in the 4th century.    In the 17th century, mathematicians and philosophers Rene Descarte and Piere de Fermat independently connected geometry and algebra with a coordinate system we use in basic algebra today. This system is called \"Cartesian coordiantes\" after Descartes.       Thinking Differently  Studying math history also helps us see how culture impacts the way we think about things... even objective ideas such as mathematics. We can see that ancient cultures sometimes approached their problems from a perspective we might find unusual.   Egyptian Multiplication      One of two surviving Egyptian mathematical papyri: The Rhind Papyrus    Ancient Egyptians were excellent at calculations, with applications in areas of economics, land area, and volumes of solids. They developed algorithms to help perform complicated calculations with high accuracy. We will look at their alogrithm for multiplying two integers.  For example, How would the Egyptians multiply 23 and 12? Their work all depends up powers of two.   Writing out Powers of 2   Fill out the following tables with powers of two.      Powers of 2      value                                     value     1     2     4     8     16        This method is sometimes referred to as the \"double method\", because the algorithm involves doubling one of the factors repeatedly. Let's do this with the first factor, 23.   Double 23   Fill out the third column of the table by repeatedly doubling 23.               1  23     2       4       8       16                       1  23     2  46     4  92     8  184     16  368        Now we need to write our other factor as a sum of powers of two. For example, .   Powers of 2 to get 12   Write 12 as a sum of powers of 2.         We determined earlier that , and we just need to add the corresponding rows from .                 1  23       2  46       4  92       8  184        16  368           Our Final Calculation   Add up the appropriate multiples of to calculate .    From , we see the entries in rows corredsponding to and are and . So we conclude that .       Another Multiplication Question   Multiply as would the Egyptians.      Mathematics of Babylon  Unfortunately, due to the again of papyrus, we have few resources to pull from regarding Egyptian mathematics. However, the Babylonians baked their writings in cuneiform on clay tablets. This more durable writing system has provided us with a lot of information regarding Babylonian mathematics dating back to 1700 BC.      The Babylonian cuneiform tablet: Plimpton 322    Babylon made a lot of advancement in mathematics with knowledge of cubic equations and Pythagoras' namesake, the Pythagorean Theorem (about 1000 years before Pythagoras), but we will just focus on the Babylonian number system.  Babylonians tracked numbers in base-60 (sexigesimal). Though that may sound odd, we still use sexigesimal systems when thinking about time (60 seconds to a minute) and angle measure ( in a circle).  So what does sexigesimal notation look like? Think about typing on a microwave. After a second, what does that microwave read? Not , right? The microwave knows that minute means seconds, and so after a second, we see .  Similarly, the Babylonian would write for what we mean by . We would read a number like base-60 as base-10.   Sexigesimal Practice   Convert into base-10.         Sexigesimal notation is particularly useful when dealing with fractions. For example, is , and by , the Babylonians mean .  To calculate , Babylonians would first find and then multiply it by . For example, is found first by finding and then multiply the result by to get     We finish our calculation by recognizing .   Practicing with Sexigesimal Fractions  Represent as a sexigesimal fraction.      Mathigon's Timeline of Mathematics       Mathigon has currated an interactive map of significant mathematical moments.

Some of our normal addition rules act differently when is involved. For example, can help us show that ? Let's start with , and we know that Can't we do this forever?     This is a problem! Apparently, the associate law of addition doesn't play well with . You'll discuss this example in greater detail in a later course, but this is enough to show that can be very unusual.  HILBERT HOTEL VIDEO    In Hilbert's hotel, how do we accommodate a new customer if all rooms are booked?      In Hilbert's hotel, how do we accommodate new customers if all rooms are booked?      In Hilbert's hotel, how do we accommodate an infinite new customers if all rooms are booked?    Rules like sound impossible, until we consider the strange creature we call .   Not always unpredictable  However, is not completely unpredictable in all cases. Actually, we should say that a pattern trending towards infinity is sometimes predictable.  For example, consider the function . What happens as the variable gets larger and larger (trends towards ).    Fill out the following table and make a decision about what happens to as trends towards .                                                          What's your decision?    So it seems as gets closer to , gets closer to 0. Let's try something else. This time, let's let get close to .    Fill out the following table and make a decision about what happens to as trends towards .                                                          What's your decision?    This time, seems to get larger and larger. We could say that as trends towards (at least from the positive side of the number line), trends towards .  Actually, a graph would make these trends obvious.   A cubic plotted by SageMath on   A cubic function on the interval [-3,2]       Movement On Paper  Trends like the ones we looked at in and are examples of limits , a foundational tool in the study of Calculus. We would write the conclusions from the past activities like We'll save defining limits clearly for your other coursework, but we can think about limits intuitively.  Firstly, we can think of limits as a way to introduce motion on paper. We \"watched\" the behavior of as \"moved\" towards . There are other examples in which we allow the number rectangles or the number of sides or the number terms and so on extend towards . The limit is similar to the play button on a YouTube video. When you see , you can just imagine some sort of movement or change on your paper.  Secondly, the limit is the tool that allows us to tame ... Well, not \"tame\" , but we can utilize with a limit to accomplish some incredible things. We don't tame the Mississippi River, but it is an enormous resource!    So what is Calculus?  So what is calculus exactly? Calculus is a multifaceted branch of mathematics that serves as the bedrock of an enormous number of applications in a a huge variety of fields. However, common to all of the underlying ideas of calculus is harnessing through limits to do something.  Let's look at some examples of how, in some cases, we can predict the infinite. The first should be familiar to us.    Limit of Functions  Use a table to evaluate (By , we mean we approach from the left side of the number line. Try using numbers like and so on.)   Earlier, we added an infinite number of times. Can we actually add an infinite amount of numbers and get a finite answer? Calculus says, \"Yes! It is possible.\"  A geometric series is a summation of the powers of a number . So it looks like For a lot of numbers, this sum gets larger and larger, but if , the sum will equal . This should surprise you in some way. We can add up an infinite number of numbers and actually calculate the result with a nice, clean formula!   Finding Geometric Series   Calculuate the geometric series corresponding to :     The value of in this case is , which is less than , so our formula applies.     All of that adds up to ? Wow. What about if we let ?   Another Geometric Series   Calculuate the geometric series corresponding to :     Like , , so     Let's look at one more example.    Recursive Sequences  A sequence , , is just an infinite list of terms. A familiar example would be , the sequence of natural numbers. A sequence is different than a set in that the order of the terms matters. So is the term in the sequence . Make sense? The terms in a sequence typically are defined by a rule. For example, if , then   A sequence is a recursive sequence if the rule for involves earlier terms in the sequence. For example, suppose and, after the first term, . Then and so on.   Recursive Terms   What is in our recursive sequence?    The big question is whether this recurvise sequence, like the function and the geometric series we saw earlier, has a limit? The answer is \"yes\", but how would we find it?  If you take an analysis course (Maybe Advanced Calculus or Intro to Real Analysis), you will see questions like this, and to find a limit of our recursive sequence you would have to prove two important pieces of information. First, the terms in our sequence either need to get progessively smaller or larger with each sequential term, and secondly all of the terms must be smaller than some number and larger than another number (That is, for each term .).  If these two facts are true, then the Monotone Convergence Theorem guarantees the recursive sequence has a limit.    Does the recursive sequence defined by and satisfy the conditions of the Monotone Convergence Theorem? (See the solution.)    Yes, it does, but proving that is beyond the scope of what we're doing here. It can be a little complicated.    In mathematics, it's not a good idea to take things for granted, but for the purpose of illustration, suppose we have shown that is decreasing (getting smaller with each term) and always larger than . That means that our sequence does have a limit. Let's call this mysterious limit point , and here's how we find what is.  We know that , and so that also means that . So   All of that to say that our limit satisfies the equation     Find the limit point of our sequence by solving the equation     This is just algebra at this point. So either or , but we already know that so .    This is a complicated example, but we are highlighting how even though can act strangely, we can use it to answer complicated quesetions... like how this sequence will trend towards !   "

But the great mathematician, Archimedes, was really close to developing Calculus in 300 B.C. (Almost 2000 years before Newton and Leibniz!) with the formation of the limit: the starting point of well-defined calculus (though he never used the word ``limit\" in his construction.).   What is this weird number?  To illustrate how Archimedes was thinking in terms of calculus, we should think about circles. Ancient cultures were puzzled that every circle carried an unusual trait with it. That is, if the circle had diameter , then it would take length plus a tiny bit more to wrap around the circumference.  This fact was true with every circle, and each culture attempted to calculate the number that was the ratio of circumference to diameter. No one in the ancient world estimated it as well as Archimedes did.  So what is this number? We define as for the circle with circumference and diameter . Computers can now calculate to millions of digits, but eluded the greatest of minds for centuries.  For reference, here are the first 30 digits of .     Archimedes' Estimate  Archimedes was interested in figuring out the very mysterious number of , and eventually estimated to be between and (or between ). That's really, really close for 300 BC.     "
