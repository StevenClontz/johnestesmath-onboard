  <title>Coloring Graphs </title>

  <p> Consider the map  of the United States in figure \ref{map}. You are challenged to color the map with the rule that bordering states cannot have the same color. Overall this is pretty easy, BUT we also want to use the fewest colors possible. How many colors do you need to do this? </p>

  <question xml:id="ques-fourcolor1">
    <title>Color the map</title>
    
    
    <statement>
      <p>
        Color the map in the fewest colors possible, where neighboring states do not share a color.
      </p>

  <question xml:id="ques-fourcolor2">
    <title>How many colors?</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        So how many colors did it take to color your map?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The minimum number of colors is <m> 4</m>.
      </p>
    </solution> 
    
    
  </question>

  <p>
    In this context, if we treat each state as a vertex and shared borders
    as edges, then this map is just a graph. The challenge we gave to color the map
    then is really a challenge to color a graph with this rule: if two vertices share an
    edge, those vertices must be different colors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finding the minimum colors to color a graph is a common graph theory question.

    <title>Coloring Trees</title>
    
    <p>
      A graph is called a tree if it is connected and has no cycles. More precisely, there is a path
      between any two vertices... but only one path.

    LET"S MAKE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT COLORING TREES WITH 2 COLORS.
  </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-fourcolor2">
    <title>Graphs with two colors</title>
    <p>
      We found a graph that requires four colors. Do all graphs require four? Absolutely not.

      <p>
        Draw a graph where the vertices can be colored in 2 colors.

    <title>Appel and Haken shook things up</title>

    <p>
      We'll now turn our attention to something similar to coloring the map of the US.
      Is it possible to draw a country with states that would require more than four colors? The answer is
      actually no!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In 1976, Appel and Haken proved their famous Four Color Theorem, but this result
      brought a good bit of controversy. Numberphile's fantastic video belows covers the controversy surrounding
       the Four Color Theorem.
