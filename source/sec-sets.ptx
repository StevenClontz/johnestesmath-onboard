  <title>Sets and Shopping Carts</title>

  <p> Sunday afternoon at the local supermarket is a bustling place. Shoppers cut each other off for the last jar of salsa with a smile and a 'pardon me'. 
    Amid the somewhat friendly and mostly competitive crowd, long-time friends Yuri and Kalo bump into each other in front of the caulifluer. 
    It's always a bit awkward looking into someone else's shopping cart (feels like a violation of privacy, right?), but Yuri couldn't help but notice
    that there was some overlap. </p>

    "Hey, I like rice cakes, too. Look!" exclaimed Yuri holding up a bag of rice cakes from his cart.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Oh, I hate them! Those are for my mom," replied Kalo. Yuri frowned.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anyway... the two carts looked like this:

<subsection xml:id="subsec-sets">
  <title>Collections of Things</title>
  
    
  <p> There's some mathematics going on here. Anytime we have find a collection of items (like a shopping cart) we have a mathematical object called a set. </p>
  <definition> A <term>set</term> is simply a collection
of objects referred to as <term>elements</term>.</definition> 

<p> Let's call the set of Yuri's cart <m>Y</m>, written as 
<m> Y  = </m> { rice cakes, caulifluer, halibut, coffee creamer, spicy ramen, cilantro, yellow onion, corn chips, salami, eggs } . Similarly <m> K = </m> {rice cakes, caulifluer, tuna, crab legs, spicy ramen, parsley, red onion, cookies, bagels, salami, and cream cheese} is the set representing Kalo's cart. So halibut
is an element of <m>Y</m> (written as halibet <m>\in Y</m>), and tuna <m> \in K</m>.

  </p>

  <p>
    The overlap between their two carts represents the "intersection of Y and K", <m> Y \cap K</m>.</p>
    
  <definition>  In general for sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, the <term> intersection of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> </term>, <m>A \cap B</m>, is the set of elements in both sets.
  </definition>

  <question xml:id="q-setintersect">
    <title>Yuri and Kalo's intersection</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
      What would <m> Y \cap K </m> contain?    </p>
    </statement>
</question>

<p>
  Another friend interrupts Yuri and Kalo's meeting. JACOBI greets them both as they unapologetically rifle through his cart.
</p>

<p>
  JACOBI's cart is represented by the set <m>J = </m>  {spicy ramen, cilantro, corn chips, and eggs}. Yuri can't help notice that everything in <m>J</m> is also in <m>Y</m>. In this case,
we say that <m>J</m> is a subset of <m>Y</m>, denoted <m>J \subseteq Y</m> or <m>Y \supseteq J</m>. </p>

<p>
  So set <m>A \subseteq B</m> if for any element <m>x \in A</m>, we know also that  <m>x \in B</m>.
</p>

<question xml:id="q-setsubset">
  <title>Subsets of Dairy</title>
  <statement>
  <p>
    Let <m>D</m> be the set of all dairy items. Find a subset of <m>K</m> that is also a subset of <m>D</m>.   </p>
  </statement>
</question>

<question xml:id="q-setsubsetintersect">
  <title>Is the intersection a subset?</title>
  <statement>
  <p>
    Is <m>Y \cap K</m> a subset of <m>Y</m>?

  </statement>
</question>

<p>
  Unbeknownst to Kalo, Kalo's wife MARNIE is also in the grocery store with <m>M = </m> {caulifluer, macaroni, red onion, water, bacon}. When Kalo and MARNIE bump into each other, they decide
to finish their shopping and to consolidate their items to one cart. Kalo reshelves the caulifluer and red onion, though, since MARNIE already has those items in her cart. This new cart is 
known as the "union of K and M", <m>K \cup M </m>. </p>

<p> 
  In general, for sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, <m>A \cup B</m> is the collection of elements that are in either set (or both).

<question xml:id="q-union1">
  <title>Question of union</title>
  <statement>
  <p>
    What is <m>K \cup M</m>?

  </statement>
</question>

<question xml:id="q-union2">
  <title>Another question of union</title>
  <statement>
  <p>
    What is <m>Y \cup J</m>?
  </p>
  </statement>
</question>

<question xml:id="q-union3">
  <title>More complicated sets</title>
  <statement>
  <p>
    What about <m>(Y \cap K) \cup M</m>?

  <title>Venn Diagrams</title>
  
  <p>
    We can visualize how sets interact with each using overlapping circles with diagrams known as Venn diagrams.
  </p>

    <p>
      Some examples:

      You will now be human Venn diagrams (This works best in an open area).

    Teams give an elt in called out sets like A UNION B INTERSECT C, etc.

<remark>
  Remember that our goal is to introduce you to topics you'll cover in more detail later. There are other set operations that we won't cover here. 
  You'll see these in classes like Discrete Mathematics, Modern Algebra, and many others.
