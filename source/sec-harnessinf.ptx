  <title>Harnessing <m>\infty</m></title>

  <p> "What is the largest number you can think of?" Hopefully, you see that is a 
    question with no real answer. Maybe the closest we can come to answering that 
question is <m>\infty  \ldots</m> even though we know <m>\infty</m> is not a number. 
  </p>
<p> In fact, <m>\infty </m> is a weird creature. It breaks some of our number-intuition.
    It feels like <m>\infty</m> just does not behave. For example, can we add an infinite
    number of numbers and get something finite? We'll see that you can <m>\ldots</m> sometimes. Some of our normal addition rules act
differently when <m>\infty</m> is involved. For example, can <m>\infty</m> help us
show that <m>0 = 1 </m>? Let's start with <m>0</m>, and we know that  <m> 0 = 1 + -1 = 1 + -1 + 1 + -1.</m> 
Can't we do this forever?</p>

<p>
    <md>
      <mrow>0  \amp = (1 + -1) + (1 + -1) + 1 + \ldots </mrow>
      <mrow>   \amp =  1 + (-1 + 1) + (-1 + 1) + \ldots </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = 1 + 0 + 0 + \ldots </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp  = 1</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
<p>
   This is a problem! Apparently, the associate law of addition
   doesn't play well with <m>\infty</m>. You'll discuss this example in 
   greater detail in a later course, but this is enough to show that <m>\infty</m>
   can be very unusual.

<p>
    Rules like <m>a + 1 = a</m> sound impossible, until we consider the strange

    <title>Not always unpredictable</title>

    <p>
        However, <m>\infty</m> is not completely unpredictable in all cases. Actually, we should
        say that a pattern trending towards infinity is sometimes predictable.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, consider the function <m>f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2}</m>. What happens as the variable <m>x</m>

        This time, <m>f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2}</m> seems to get larger and larger. We could say that

        <m>f(x)</m> trends towards <m>\infty</m>.

    <p>
        Actually, a graph would make these trends obvious.

    <p>
      Trends like the ones we looked at in <xref ref="ac-limits1"/> and <xref ref="ac-limits2"/> 
      are examples of <term>limits</term>, a foundational tool in the study of Calculus. We 
      would write the conclusions from the past activities like
      <me> \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \dfrac{1}{x^2} = 0 \text{ and } \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+} \dfrac{1}{x^2} = \infty.</me>
      We'll
      save defining limits clearly for your other coursework, but we can think about limits
      intuitively.
    </p>

    <p>
      Firstly, we can think of limits as a way to introduce motion
      on paper. We "watched" the behavior of <m>f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2}</m> as <m>x</m> "moved" towards
      <m>\infty</m>. There are other examples in which we allow the number rectangles or
      the number of sides or the number terms and so on extend towards <m>\infty</m>. The limit
      is similar to the play button on a YouTube video. When you see <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a}</m>,
      you can just imagine some sort of movement or change on your paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Secondly, the limit is the tool that allows us to tame <m>\infty</m>... Well, not "tame" <m>\infty</m>,
      but we can utilize <m>\infty</m> with a limit to accomplish some incredible things. We don't tame the Mississippi River,
      but it is an enormous resource!

<subsection xml:id="subsec-whatiscalculus">
  <title>So what is Calculus?</title>
  <p>
    So what is calculus exactly? Calculus is a multifaceted branch of mathematics that 
    serves as the bedrock of an enormous number of applications in a 
    a huge variety of fields. However, common to all of the underlying ideas of calculus is
    harnessing <m>\infty</m> through limits to do something.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's look at some examples of how, in some cases, we can predict the infinite.
    The first should be familiar to us.

      <title>Limit of Functions</title>
      <p>
        Use a table to evaluate <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow 3^-} \dfrac{1}{x-3}.</m>
        (By <m>3^-</m>, we mean we approach <m>3</m> from the left side of the 
        number line. Try using numbers like <m>2, 2.9, 2.99,</m> and so on.)
      </p>
      
    </question>

    <p>
      Earlier, we added <m>1 + -1 + \ldots</m> an infinite number of times. Can we actually
      add an infinite amount of numbers and get a finite answer? Calculus says, "Yes! It is
      possible."
    </p>

    <p>
      A <term>geometric series</term> is a summation of the powers of a number <m>r</m>. So it 
      looks like 
      <me>r^0 + r^1 + r^2 + \ldots + r^n + \ldots.</me>
      For a lot of numbers, this sum gets larger and larger, but if <m> |r| \lt 1</m>, the sum
      will equal <m>1/(1-r)</m>. This should surprise you in some way. We can add
      up an infinite number of numbers and actually calculate the result with a nice, clean formula! 
    </p>

    <question xml:id="ques-limits2">

    <solution>
      <p>
        The value of <m>r</m> in this case is <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>, which is less than <m>1</m>, so 
        our formula applies.

        <me>\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^0 + \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^1 + \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \ldots = \dfrac{1}{1-1/2} = \dfrac{1}{1/2} = 2.</me>
      </p>
    </solution>
      
    </question>

    <p>
      All of that adds up to <m>2</m>? Wow. What about if we let <m>r = 2/3</m>?

      <solution>

</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-recursive">
  <title>Recursive Sequences</title>

  <p>
    A <term>sequence</term>, <m>(a_n)</m>, is just an infinite list of terms. For example,
    <m>1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots</m> is the familiar sequence of natural numbers. 
    The terms in a sequence typically are defined by a rule. If <m>a_n = n^2 + 1</m>, then <m>(a_n) = (1^2 +1), (2^2 + 1), \ldots , (n^2 +1), \ldots</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    A sequence is a <term>recursive sequence</term> if the rule for <m>a_n</m> involves earlier terms in the sequence. For example, suppose
    <m>a_1 = 1</m> and after the first term <m>a_n = \dfrac{4a_{n-1}}{3a_{n-1}+3}</m>. Then <m>a_2 = 4(a_1)/(3a_1 + 3) = 4/(3 + 3) = 2/3.</m>
