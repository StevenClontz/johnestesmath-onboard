  <title>Harnessing <m>\infty</m></title>

  <p> "What is the largest number you can think of?" Hopefully, you see that is a 
    question with no real answer. Maybe the closest we can come to answering that 
question is <m>\infty  \ldots</m> even though we know <m>\infty</m> is not a number. 
  </p>
<p> In fact, <m>\infty </m> is a weird creature. It breaks some of our number-intuition.
    It feels like <m>\infty</m> just does not behave. For example, can we add an infinite
    number of numbers and get something finite? We'll see that you can <m>\ldots</m> sometimes. Some of our normal addition rules act
differently when <m>\infty</m> is involved. For example, can <m>\infty</m> help us
show that <m>0 = 1 </m>? Let's start with <m>0</m>, and we know that  <m> 0 = 1 + -1 = 1 + -1 + 1 + -1.</m> 
Can't we do this forever?</p>

<p>
    <md>
      <mrow>0  \amp = (1 + -1) + (1 + -1) + 1 + \ldots </mrow>
      <mrow>   \amp =  1 + (-1 + 1) + (-1 + 1) + \ldots </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = 1 + 0 + 0 + \ldots </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp  = 1</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
<p>
   This is a problem! Apparently, the associate law of addition
   doesn't play well with <m>\infty</m>. You'll discuss this example in 
   greater detail in a later course, but this is enough to show that <m>\infty</m>
   can be very unusual.

<p>
    Rules like <m>a + 1 = a</m> sound impossible, until we consider the strange
    creature we call <m>\infty</m>.

    <title>Not always unpredictable</title>

    <p>
        However, <m>\infty</m> is not completely unpredictable in all cases. Actually, we should
        say that a pattern trending towards infinity is sometimes predictable.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, consider the function <m>f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2}</m>. What happens as the variable <m>x</m> 
        gets larger and larger (trends towards <m>\infty</m>).

        So it seems as <m>x</m> gets closer to <m>\infty</m>, <m>f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2}</m> gets closer to
        0. Let's try something else. This time, let's let <m>x</m> get close to <m>0</m>.

    <p>
        This time, <m>f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2}</m> seems to get larger and larger. We could say that
        as <m>x</m> trends towards <m>0</m> (at least from the positive side of the number line), 
        <m>f(x)</m> trends towards <m>\infty</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Actually, a graph would make these trends obvious.
