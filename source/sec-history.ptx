  <title>A Little History</title>

  <p> Mathematics is a permanent fixture in human development. We find evidence of mathematical thinking in
    our most ancient of civilizations, and yet all modern technological advancements rely of good mathematics.
    Mathematics is the foundational tool we use to turn creative ideas into reality. But the human stories of
    mathematics is an area worth studying as well.

    Throughout your coursework, you will learn about the interesting figures of math history and some of the
    incredible (and sometimes unbelievable) tales they are a part of. There are stories of young genius, incredible
    risks, underdogs, and duels. You will hear about mathematical giants from all over the world and how their contributions
    are still valuable to us today. Math history is
    rich and immensely interesting.

 <p>
    We will breifly share one of these tales.

    <title>Thales and the Pyramid</title>

    <p>
      Greek Mathematician, Thales of Miletus, was challenged to determine the
      height of the great pyramids of Egypt circa 600 BC. The mathematician did so using
      laws of similar triangles, a shadow, and a staff.

    <p>
      With his staff standing upright from the ground, Thales spotted similar triangles. The first triangle came
      from his staff, its shadow, and the hypotenuse between their two endpoints (just a ray of sunshine), and the second triangle required
      an extra level of insight: the pyramid's height, the pyramid's shadow plus hlaf the length of its base, and the sun ray that connects their endpoints.

   <title>What we take for granted</title>

   <p>
      We learn about rationals, primes, and equations by the time we get to 
      middle school, but so many of these ideas were unknown for generatoins. We take
      so much of our foundational mathematics for granted. Behind a lot of these concepts
      are moments of ingenious insight.
