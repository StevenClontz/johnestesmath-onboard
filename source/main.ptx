      <title>Our Goals</title>

      <p>
        Welcome to Overview of Mathematics, a quick look at what you can expect from your studies as a mathematics student.
        In particular, we hope to show
        <ol>
          <li>
            the culture of the Mathematics and Computer Science Department (MCS) at Belhaven, 
            along with the broader community of mathematicians and shared culture,
          </li>
          <li>various interesting topics of mathematics that we can explore with very little
            background experiences,  </li>
          <li> and interesting technology that pairs well with mathematical studies. </li>
        </ol> 
        And we hope to have some fun while doing it. Best practices for this course are just showing up with a good attitude and
        having a curiosity about math topics.
