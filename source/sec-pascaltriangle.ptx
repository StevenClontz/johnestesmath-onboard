  <title>A Special Triangle</title>

  <p>
    You can find all sorts of interesting examples of surprising structures in the universe of mathematics. One such example is
   a very special triangle that's easy to construct and borderline ubiquitous in its applications.
  </p>

  <p> This triangle goes by many names and was discovered by several cultures in history. In 450 BC, Indian mathematician, Pingata, called
    this new construction the "Staircase of Mount Meru". Persian mathematician, Omar Khayyam, discovered "Khauuam's Triangle" in the 11th century,
     and close to the same time, Chinese mathematician, Jin Xian, discovered "Yang Hui's Triangle".
      In the western world, this triangle is most commonly refered to as Pascal's Triangle, named after
      french mathematician, Blaise Pascal, who discovered this triangle in the 17th century.
